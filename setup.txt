You should have a game board, 100 letter tiles, a letter bag, and four racks.

Before the game begins, all players should agree upon the dictionary that they will 
use, in case of a challenge. All words labeled as a part of speech (including those 
listed of foreign origin, and as archaic, obsolete, colloquial, slang, etc.) are 
permitted with the exception of the following: words always capitalized, abbreviations, 
prefixes and suffixes standing alone, words requiring a hyphen or an apostrophe.

Place all letters in the pouch, or facedown beside the board, and mix them up. Draw for 
first play. The player with the letter closest to "A" plays first. A blank tile beats 
any letter. Return the letters to the pool and remix. All players draw seven new letters 
and place them on their racks.
