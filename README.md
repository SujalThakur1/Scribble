Scribble Game - README
Welcome to the Scribble Game, a Java-based word-building game that challenges players to strategically place words on the game board, earning points for their linguistic prowess. This README provides an overview of the game, instructions for playing, and details about additional features.

Overview
Scribble is a turn-based game where players take turns adding words to the game board. Each word must connect to an existing word on the board, creating a dynamic and evolving word landscape. Points are awarded based on the letters used, contributing to the player's overall score.

How to Play
Taking a Turn:

On each turn, a player provides a word to be added to the board.
The player specifies the position on the board and whether the word should be placed vertically or horizontally.
Rules for Placing Words:

New words must build upon existing words on the board.
The first or last letter of the new word being added must coincide with a letter in an existing word.
Words can be placed vertically or horizontally.
Scoring:

Points are calculated based on the letters used in the added word.
Each letter has a designated point value, contributing to the player's score.
Game End:

The game can end when the board is full, no valid words can be added, or a player reaches a predefined score.
The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.
